    exception handler does not translate that class, so the request answered
    500 rather than 400: a stale bookmark or a hand-edited URL took the
    endpoint down.

    multipart body cannot carry one natively, and a list of
    ``{"id": ..., "name": ...}`` objects because some clients echo back what
    the API gave them. Each view used to unpack that inline, and every copy

    ``JSONDecodeError`` and answered 500, and a malformed id reached the ORM
    and answered 500 as well.

    A bare id string is now accepted as a single-item list. Before, the update

    ``parse_date`` raises ``ValueError`` on a day that does not exist rather
    than answering ``None``, so a check looking only for ``None`` walks past it.

    A full timestamp is accepted as well as a plain date, because callers send
    both: ``mobile/lib/providers/tickets_provider.dart`` sends
    ``toUtc().toIso8601String()``. Neither column type will take that text.
    A DateField parses only ``YYYY-MM-DD``, and the datetime columns are
    filtered through ``__date`` so their range covers the end day, which parses
    only ``YYYY-MM-DD`` too. Resolving the day here rather than returning the
