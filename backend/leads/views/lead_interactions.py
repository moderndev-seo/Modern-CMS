    """DEPRECATED. Use `/api/public/forms/<org_id>/<form_id>/submit/` instead.

    This is the original web-to-lead endpoint. It is kept working, and its
    request and response bodies are unchanged, but everything new should use
    the public web form endpoint, which is genuinely anonymous, domain-bound,
    rate-limited and captcha-capable.

    WHAT CHANGED HERE, AND WHAT DID NOT

    The body of this view now hands off to `webforms.service.submit_form`, the
    same write path the public endpoint uses. That is what repairs the six
    defects it carried, each of which now has a test in
    `leads/tests/test_create_lead_from_site.py`:

      * it 500'd on EVERY successful call. `Lead.assigned_to` is an M2M to
        Profile and this passed `api_setting.created_by`, which is a User, so
        `assigned_to.add()` raised TypeError. The endpoint has never returned
        200 in any configuration.
      * a repeat submission from one address raised IntegrityError against
        `Lead`'s `UniqueConstraint(Lower("email"), "org")`.
      * `APISettings.lead_assigned_to` was never read, so the configured
        recipients were notified of nothing.
      * `APISettings.tags` was never applied to the lead.
      * `Lead.objects.create()` skipped serializer validation, so a malformed
        email or an over-length value reached the database.
      * `Lead.source` was assigned `api_setting.website`, a URL, while that
        column declares `choices=LEAD_SOURCE`. Those rows were invisible to
        every source-based filter.

    REACHABILITY IS UNCHANGED, deliberately. This still requires a JWT or an
    org API key. `apiSettings` is an RLS-scoped table, so an anonymous caller
    cannot look up its own key without either carving that table out of RLS or
    moving the org into the URL, and neither is worth doing to an endpoint the
    public one replaces.

    One narrowing: the key lookup is filtered on `request.org`. RLS made that
    true in production already, since the lookup runs under the caller's own
    context, but the ORM filter is the contract and without it the endpoint
    behaved differently on a superuser database than on a correct one.

    The backing form is provisioned on first use by
    `webforms.legacy.ensure_web_form`, not assumed. Migration 0002 covers the
    keys that predate this feature, but it is a one-shot: nothing else ever set
    `legacy_api_setting`, so a key minted afterwards through the settings
    screen had no form and this endpoint refused it permanently.
