"""The legacy web-to-lead endpoint, `/api/leads/create-from-site/`.

This endpoint has existed for years with no test coverage at all, and carried
six defects because of it. The tests below pin each one.

REACHABILITY IS DELIBERATELY UNCHANGED. It still needs a JWT or an org API key,
exactly as before, which is why these tests use an authenticated client. Making
it anonymously reachable is impossible without either carving `apiSettings` out
of RLS or changing its URL, and the new `/api/public/forms/` endpoint is the
answer to that rather than weakening either. See
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-16-web-forms-design.md`.
