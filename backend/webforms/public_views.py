"""Anonymous endpoints reached from a customer's website.

No JWT, no session, no portal token. `permission_classes = (AllowAny,)` plus an
empty `authentication_classes` is the pattern `cases/csat_views.py` established
for exactly this.

READ THE ORDER BELOW BEFORE CHANGING IT.

`org_id` comes from the URL and the RLS context is set from it BEFORE anything
queries. This is not a stylistic choice. `web_form` is an org-scoped table, so
under an empty RLS context the lookup returns zero rows on a correctly
configured Postgres. Resolving the form first and reading its org afterwards is
what leaves `/api/public/invoice/`, `/api/public/estimate/` and the CSAT
endpoints answering 404 in production today.

The org id is not a credential and is not treated as one. It selects the
tenant, and the form row is then filtered on it, so a mismatched pair answers
404 like every other miss.
