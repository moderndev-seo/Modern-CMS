"""Serializers for the authenticated web form management API.

Two rules run through all of this:

* anything the server derives is `read_only` or popped. `org`, `created_by` and
  `is_published` are never taken from a request body. Publishing in particular
  has its own endpoint because it validates the source state and the form's
  shape, and a writable `is_published` would be a second door onto the same
  transition with none of those checks.
* the field list is replaced wholesale, with `order` assigned from list
  position. A client that sends its own `order` cannot reorder a form by lying
  about it, and a drag-reorder is one atomic request rather than N.
