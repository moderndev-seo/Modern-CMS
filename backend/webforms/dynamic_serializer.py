"""Builds a DRF serializer from one form's WebFormField rows.

The schema is rows in a table, so the serializer is built per form. Two things
that buys, which a hand-written serializer would not:

* a form that collects three fields cannot be used to write a fourth. Every
  Lead column (or ticket field) not on the form is simply absent from the
  serializer, so DRF drops it. Dropping rather than answering 400 is
  deliberate: a 400 would tell a prober which columns exist.
* the honeypot is declared here rather than in the view, so a second caller
  cannot forget it.
