"""Embeddable web forms that create leads (issue #634) or tickets.

Four models. `WebForm` is the configuration an admin edits, `WebFormField` is
one ordered question on it, `WebFormSubmission` is one POST from a visitor
(stored whether it was accepted or rejected, which is what makes spam review
and an honest conversion rate possible), and `WebFormDailyStat` counts embed
renders so conversion has a denominator.

All four inherit BaseOrgModel and are registered in
`common/rls/__init__.py:ORG_SCOPED_TABLES`. Note that a subclass declaring its
own `class Meta` REPLACES the parent's rather than merging it, so each one
restates `indexes = [Index(fields=["org", "-created_at"])]`.
`common/tests/test_org_index_coverage.py` fails if one forgets, which is how
`orders` silently lost both of its per-org indexes.
