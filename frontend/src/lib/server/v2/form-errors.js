/**
 * Turning a DRF rejection back into a sentence.
 *
 * The API answers a bad save with `{"error": true, "errors": {"field":
 * ["message"]}}`, and `apiRequest` flattens that into an Error whose message
 * carries the JSON. Showing "Request failed" over the top of it throws away the
 * one useful thing in the response: the API already said exactly what was wrong
 * with which field.
 *
 * This lived twice in the accounts routes and was about to live twice more in
 * contacts. Two copies of a function is how the backend ended up with five
 * different opinions about who may open a record.

   * OBJECT (a per-field map) and for `error` as a STRING, and this shape is
   * neither, so it falls through to the generic entry-flattener and produces
   * "errors: Add an email field before publishing." The JSON key ends up in
   * the sentence a person reads, on every one of the fifty-odd pages that
   * call this. Reading `err.body` (which `apiRequest` attaches) skips the
   * flattening entirely and gets the sentence the API actually wrote.
   *
   * A per-field map is deliberately left alone: "name: This field may not be
   * blank" needs the field name, and `apiRequest` already renders it well.
   *
   * A blank one falls to `fallback` rather than to the flattened message,
   * because the flattened message in that case is the bare string "errors:"
   * and an empty apology beside a failed save reads as though it worked.
