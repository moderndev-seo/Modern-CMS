/**
 * Goals: the twelfth v2 module wired to the real API.
 *
 * Lives under `$lib/server` like the eleven before it: SvelteKit keeps this
 * directory out of the client bundle, so the httpOnly access token never
 * reaches the browser. Org is a JWT claim the backend re-derives; it is never a
 * parameter here.
 *
 * WHY THIS MODULE
 * `/goals` is a sidebar dead rail: every live page links to it and it still
 * read a fixture, its "New goal" button writing nowhere. Wiring it drove
 * `SalesGoalListView`, `SalesGoalLeaderboardView` and `SalesGoalDetailView`
 * (`/api/opportunities/goals/…`) for real. Reads *and* the admin-only
 * create/update/delete writes.
 *
 * THE FINDING THE WIRING EXPOSED
 * `SalesGoalCreateSerializer` exposed `assigned_to` (a Profile) and `team` with
 * DRF's default all-rows queryset and no org check. `common_profile` is not
 * RLS-protected, so before the backend fix an admin could POST/PUT a goal
 * assigned to a Profile in *another org*, leaking that person's name and email
 * into this org's goal detail and leaderboard. The fix scopes both to the
 * caller's org in the serializer (the trust boundary); this file only ever
 * offers in-org people and teams in its pickers, but that is a UX hint, not the
 * guard.
 *
 * WHAT THE MOCK ASSUMED THAT THE API SHAPES DIFFERENTLY
 * - The fixture pre-joined `assigned_to`/`team` to `{ id, name }`. The API sends
 *   the raw FK plus a nested `assigned_to_detail` / `team_detail`; `toGoal`
 *   flattens those back to the shape the page reads.
 * - The leaderboard fixture carried `user` as a bare string. The API nests
 *   `user: { id, name, email }`, so `toLeaderRow` collapses it to a name.
 * - There is **no** totals endpoint. The fixture's `goalTotals` is recomputed
 *   here from the fetched goals (sum over the active subset), arithmetic on
 *   fields already in the payload, never a second aggregate query.
