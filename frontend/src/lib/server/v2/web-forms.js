/**
 * Web forms: the wiring behind `/settings/web-forms`.
 *
 * Server-only, like every module in this directory: `$lib/server` is the one
 * path SvelteKit refuses to bundle into client code, and a form's captcha
 * secret passes through here on its way to the API.
 *
 * WHO MAY DO WHAT
 * Reading is open to any member of the org; every write is admin-only. The two
 * halves are not the same risk. A web form is an anonymous endpoint that writes
 * leads or tickets into the org, so creating one is closer to minting a credential than to
 * editing a record, and `webforms/views.py` refuses a non-admin's POST, PUT,
 * DELETE, publish and unpublish. `canManage` below is a display hint read off
 * the JWT so the page can hide buttons that would 403; it is not the
 * authorization, which is re-derived from `request.profile` server-side.
 *
 * `is_published` IS NEVER SENT THROUGH `updateWebForm`
 * Publishing has its own endpoint because it validates the source state and
 * the form's shape: already-published is a 400 rather than a no-op, a form
 * with no email field cannot be published (that field is what lets a repeat
 * submission update the existing lead instead of failing), and a form set to
 * redirect on success must have a redirect URL. `WebFormDetailSerializer`
 * lists `is_published` in `read_only_fields`, so putting it in an update body
 * is silently ignored rather than rejected. That silence is the trap: a page
 * that sent it would appear to work and would never publish anything. The
 * allow-list in `buildBody` is what keeps it from being sent at all.
 *
 * TOTALS COME FROM THE SERVER, NOT FROM COUNTING ROWS
 * The list is paginated at ten. The `totals` block on the response is computed
 * over every form in the org, so "3 published" stays true past the tenth form.
 * Nothing here recounts the page.
