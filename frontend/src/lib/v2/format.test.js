/**
 * A date and an instant are not the same kind of value, and the API sends both.
 *
 * `created_at` is an instant: an ISO timestamp with an offset, and rendering it
 * in the reader's timezone is exactly right. `due_date`, `close_date`, and
 * every analytics bucket label are calendar dates with no time and no zone.
 * `new Date('2026-08-07')` reads those as UTC midnight, so a browser west of
 * UTC prints the day before: a ticket-volume bar the API labelled the 7th sits
 * under the 6th, and a task due Friday reads as due Thursday.
 *
 * These run pinned to New York, because in a UTC or an Indian test process the
 * bug is invisible: the shift only shows up in zones behind UTC.
