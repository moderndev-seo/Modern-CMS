  /**
   * What happens when a ticket blows its target.
   *
   * One EscalationPolicy per priority, enforced by a unique constraint. The
   * useful question is not "is there a policy", there always is at most one
   * per priority, but "does it do anything", and the model allows two separate
   * ways for the answer to be no:
   *
   *   · is_active is false, so the scan skips the policy whole
   *   · the half's target FK is null, whatever its action and whatever the
   *     notify team (SET_NULL empties it when a profile is removed, silently)
   *
   * Both look identical in v1's form, a row of selects with something chosen.
   * Here the breach count sits next to the outcome, so "11 breaches, nobody
   * told" is one line rather than two screens. The rule itself lives in
   * `outcome.js`, with its tests: see the note there for the three combinations
   * this page used to report as live while the engine did nothing with them.
   *
   * Only four priorities exist and each may have at most one policy
   * (`(org, priority)` unique constraint, enforced again by
   * `EscalationPolicySerializer.validate()` on create). So "New policy"
   * offers only the priorities with no policy yet, and disappears once all
   * four are configured: a disabled button with no explanation is the dead
   * end this phase exists to remove, not a control worth keeping around.
   *
   * `priority` never appears on the edit form. `EscalationPolicyDetailView.put`
   * strips the key from the request body before the serializer sees it, so an
   * edit that offered it would report success and change nothing.
